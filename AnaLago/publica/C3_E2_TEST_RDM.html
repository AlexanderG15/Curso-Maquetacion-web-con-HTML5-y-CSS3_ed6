        <p><h2>About Roller Derby Madrid </h2>
          Roller Derby Madrid was formed in <time datetime="2012-01-01 00:99:01">2012</time> by a group of women  determined to bring the sport of roller derby to their city. Since then, they have played a host of national and international teams, both at home and away. The league is made up of members who work hard to make it the best league it can be, promoting teamwork and supportive competition among sportswomen. <blockquote> We became a WFTDA Apprentice League in <time datetime="2012-01-01 00:99:01">2015 </time>and founded our B team in <time datetime="2012-01-01 00:99:01">2016</time>: <em>two of our proudest achievements to date.</em></blockquote>
